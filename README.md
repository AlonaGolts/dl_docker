# dl_docker
docker for deep learning research

This is based on http://github.com/ufoym/deepo.

Simply run ./build_docker.sh to build, then ./run_docker.sh to run.

* note: may need to do "xhost +local:root" on the host to enable display support. This is supposedly insecure... use google for a safer solution.

# dl_docker
docker for deep learning research

This is based on http://github.com/ufoym/deepo. But meant to be simpler, and tailored to my needs.

Simply run ./build_docker.sh to build, then ./run_docker.sh to run.

At this time, for the docker to build you need to manually put the cudnn 5.0 archive (named "cudnn-8.0-linux-x64-v5.0-ga.tgz") at the root directory. Kind of ugly, I know...
